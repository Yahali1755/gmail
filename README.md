This mail app is a fullstack project with a Node js and Express server with MongoDB and jwt authentication, and a react client using react query. This project is implementing a gmail app, with basic authentication  and the ability to send a recieve emails with some nice UI.
Tihs is a relatively big project that covers the basics that a junior fullstack developer should know, this was the last exrecise during my fullstack trainer when I transitioned from being a QA Engineer to being a fullstack developer.
It was reviewed by experienced developers in the unit that I served in, and has good, highly maintable code that can scale well.
